Fake News Detection 
Description
This project classifies news articles or headlines as fake or real based on simple keyword matching. It uses pre-defined sets of fake news and real news keywords to determine the classification.

How It Works
The program splits the input text into individual words.
It checks for matches between the words and a set of predefined fake and real keywords.
If more fake keywords are present, it classifies the article as Fake. If more real keywords are present, it's classified as Real.
